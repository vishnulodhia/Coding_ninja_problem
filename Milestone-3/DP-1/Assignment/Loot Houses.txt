The second line of input contains 'n' integer values separated by a single space denoting the amount of money each house has.
Output format :
Print the the maximum money that can be looted.
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10 ^ 4

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
6
5 5 10 100 10 5
Sample Output 1 :
110
Sample Input 2 :

10 2 30 20 3 50
Sample Output 2 :
90
Explanation of Sample Output 2 :
Looting first, third, and the last houses([10 + 30 + 50]) will result in the maximum loot, and all the other possible combinations would result in less than 90.

return max1;
 }	

int max2 = Math.max(max1,houses[1]);
int max_value = 0;

max2 = max_value;
